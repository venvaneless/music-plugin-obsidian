## Question: How do I ensure Git automatically pulls the files to itself after every change you or I make, each file as a new file, instead of updating the original file? I want the original file to be the oldest, and each change being saved as a new version in the branch.

### Response:
To ensure Git automatically saves each change as a new file (instead of updating the original file), you can implement a custom workflow. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Steps to Automate Saving Changes as New Files in Git

1. **Create a Script to Duplicate Files**:
   - Write a script that duplicates the file with a timestamp or unique identifier whenever a change is detected.

2. **Commit the New File to Git**:
   - The script will also stage and commit the new file to Git.

3. **Use a File Watcher**:
   - Use a tool like `fswatch` to monitor changes in your workspace and trigger the script.

---

### Example Script
Here’s a script that automates this process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory to watch and the Git repository
WATCH_DIR="/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin"
BRANCH_NAME="versioned-files"

# Ensure the branch exists
git checkout -B "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Monitor changes in the directory
fswatch -o "$WATCH_DIR" | while read -r event; do
  # Get the list of changed files
  CHANGED_FILES=$(git status --porcelain | awk '{print $2}')

  for FILE in $CHANGED_FILES; do
    # Skip directories and untracked files
    if [[ -f "$FILE" ]]; then
      # Create a new version of the file with a timestamp
      TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
      EXTENSION="${FILE##*.}"
      BASENAME="${FILE%.*}"
      NEW_FILE="${BASENAME}_${TIMESTAMP}.${EXTENSION}"

      # Copy the file to create a new version
      cp "$FILE" "$NEW_FILE"

      # Add and commit the new file to Git
      git add "$NEW_FILE"
      git commit -m "New version of $FILE saved as $NEW_FILE"
    fi
  done
done
```

---

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the script as `auto_versioning.sh` in your workspace.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x auto_versioning.sh
   ```

3. **Install `fswatch`**:
   - Install `fswatch` using Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install fswatch
     ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Start the script to monitor changes:
     ```bash
     ./auto_versioning.sh
     ```

---

### How It Works
- The script monitors your workspace for changes.
- When a file is modified, it creates a new version of the file with a timestamp.
- The new file is added and committed to Git as a separate file.

---

## Question: Why does `version_tracker.sh` need a `version_tracker.txt` file but `branch_tracker.sh` does not?

### Response:
The difference lies in how the two scripts handle version tracking and branch creation:

---

### 1. **`version_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - This script creates new versioned files (e.g., `Features v.1x.md`, `Features v.2x.md`) for each change.
- **Why It Needs `version_tracker.txt`**:
  - The script uses `version_tracker.txt` to keep track of the current version number for each file.
  - Without this file, the script would not know which version to assign to the next file.
- **How It Works**:
  - For each file, the script:
    1. Reads the current version from `version_tracker.txt`.
    2. Increments the version number.
    3. Updates `version_tracker.txt` with the new version.

---

### 2. **`branch_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - This script creates a new Git branch (e.g., `Features v.1x`, `Features v.2x`) for each change.
- **Why It Does Not Need `branch_tracker.txt`**:
  - Git itself tracks branches, so there is no need for an external file to manage branch versions.
  - The script dynamically generates branch names based on the file name and the number of existing branches.
- **How It Works**:
  - For each file, the script:
    1. Checks Git for existing branches with similar names.
    2. Creates a new branch with the next version number (e.g., `Features v.3x`).

---

### Key Difference:
- **`version_tracker.sh`**:
  - Relies on `version_tracker.txt` to manage version numbers for files because Git does not inherently track file versions as separate files.
- **`branch_tracker.sh`**:
  - Leverages Git's built-in branch management, so no external file is needed.

---

### Summary:
- `version_tracker.sh` needs `version_tracker.txt` because it tracks file versions manually.
- `branch_tracker.sh` does not need `branch_tracker.txt` because Git already tracks branches.

---

## Question: `branch_version.sh` gives me this:
`/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My\ Plugins/my\ plugin/branch_tracker.sh ; exit;`

### Response:
The message:

```
/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My\ Plugins/my\ plugin/branch_tracker.sh ; exit;
```

is not an error. It is likely the command you executed in the terminal to run the `branch_tracker.sh` script. Here's what it means:

---

### Explanation:
1. **Path to the Script**:
   - `/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My\ Plugins/my\ plugin/branch_tracker.sh`:
     - This is the full path to the `branch_tracker.sh` script you are running.
     - The `\` is used to escape the space in the folder name (`My Plugins`).

2. **`; exit;`**:
   - This is a command that tells the terminal to exit the current shell session after the script finishes running.
   - It is often appended automatically by some terminal environments (e.g., macOS Terminal) when you run a script or command.

---

### Why You See This:
- If you double-clicked the script or ran it in a terminal session, the terminal might display the command it executed, followed by `; exit;` to indicate that the session will close after the script completes.

---

### What to Do:
- If the script is running as expected (e.g., creating branches for file changes), you can ignore this message.
- If the script is not running or exiting prematurely, check for errors in the script or terminal output.

---

### How to Keep the Terminal Open:
If you want the terminal to stay open after running the script:
1. Open the terminal manually.
2. Navigate to the script's directory:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin"
   ```
3. Run the script directly:
   ```bash
   ./branch_tracker.sh
   ```

This way, the terminal will remain open, and you can see the script's output.

### Review of the `.sh` Files in Your Plugin Folder

#### 1. **`version_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - Tracks changes to files in your plugin folder and creates new versioned files for each change.
  - Each versioned file contains **only the new data added** since the last version, while reflecting any removed data.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **Version Tracking**:
     - Uses a `version_tracker.txt` file to keep track of the current version number for each file.
  2. **File Monitoring**:
     - Monitors the plugin folder for changes using `fswatch`.
  3. **Versioned File Creation**:
     - Creates a new file with a name like `Features v.2x.md` for each version.
     - The new file contains only the differences (new data added or removed) compared to the previous version.
  4. **Git Integration**:
     - Automatically commits and pushes the new versioned file to the Git repository.

- **Example Workflow**:
  - If `Features.md` is modified:
    - The script creates `Features v.1x.md`, `Features v.2x.md`, etc., with only the new changes.
    - Commits and pushes the new version to Git.

---

#### 2. **`branch_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - Tracks changes to files in your plugin folder and creates a new Git branch for each version.
  - Each branch contains the **cumulative data** (old and new changes combined) for the file.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **Branch Tracking**:
     - Uses a `branch_tracker.txt` file to keep track of the current version number for each file.
  2. **File Monitoring**:
     - Monitors the plugin folder for changes using `fswatch`.
  3. **Branch Creation**:
     - Creates a new branch with a name like `Features v.2x` for each version.
     - Appends new data to the file in the branch, keeping old data intact.
  4. **Latest File Download**:
     - Downloads the latest version of the file (with cumulative data) to the plugin folder.
     - The downloaded file does **not** include the version number in its filename (e.g., `Features.md`).

- **Example Workflow**:
  - If `Features.md` is modified:
    - The script creates branches like `Features v.1x`, `Features v.2x`, etc.
    - Appends new data to the file in the branch.
    - Downloads the latest version of the file (e.g., `Features.md`) to the plugin folder.

---

### Summary of Features:
| Feature                          | `version_tracker.sh`                  | `branch_tracker.sh`                  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Tracks changes to files          | ✅                                    | ✅                                   |
| Creates versioned files          | ✅ (e.g., `Features v.2x.md`)         | ❌                                   |
| Creates Git branches             | ❌                                    | ✅ (e.g., `Features v.2x`)           |
| Appends old and new data         | ❌ (only new data in each version)    | ✅ (cumulative data in each branch)  |
| Downloads latest file            | ❌                                    | ✅ (e.g., `Features.md`)             |
| Uses a tracker file              | ✅ (`version_tracker.txt`)            | ✅ (`branch_tracker.txt`)            |
| Git integration (commit/push)    | ✅                                    | ✅                                   |

---

### Key Differences:
- **`version_tracker.sh`**:
  - Focuses on creating new versioned files for each change.
  - Each versioned file contains only the new data added since the last version.

- **`branch_tracker.sh`**:
  - Focuses on creating new branches for each version.
  - Each branch contains cumulative data (old + new changes).
  - Downloads the latest version of the file without the version number in its filename.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or modifications to these scripts!### Troubleshooting `branchtracker.sh` and `.plist` Issues
#### 1. **Validate the `.plist` File**
Run the following command to ensure the `.plist` file is valid:
```bash
plutil -lint ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
```
If there are any errors, they will be displayed.
#### 2. **Check the Script Path**
Ensure the script path in the `.plist` file is correct:
```xml
<string>/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh</string>
```
Verify that the script exists at this location:
```bash
ls -l "/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh"
```
#### 3. **Check Permissions**
Ensure the `.plist` file and the script have the correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
chmod +x "/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh"
```

#### 4. **Test the Script Manually**
Run the script manually to check for errors:
```bash
/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh
```
If it fails, the error message will help identify the issue.
#### 5. **Add Logging to the Script**
Modify the script to log its execution and errors. Add the following line at the top of the script:
```bash
echo "Script started at $(date)" >> /Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.log
```
This will create a log file (`branchtracker.log`) to capture the script's behavior.
#### 6. **Reload the `.plist` File**
Unload and reload the `.plist` file:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
```
#### 7. **Use `launchctl bootstrap`**
If the issue persists, try using `launchctl bootstrap`:
```bash
sudo launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
```
#### 8. **Check System Logs**
If the `.plist` still fails to load, check the system logs for more details:
```bash
log show --predicate 'process == "launchd"' --info
```
### How to Push `Git.md` to a Branch Using `branchtracker.sh`
#### Steps to Push `Git.md` to the Branch:
1. **Ensure the Script is Running**:
   - Verify that the `branchtracker.sh` script is running in the background:
     ```bash
     launchctl list | grep com.myplugin.branchtracker
     ```
2. **Modify the `Git.md` File**:
   - Make a small change to the `Git.md` file (e.g., add a space or a comment) to trigger the script.

3. **Manually Trigger the Script**:
   - If the script is not running, you can manually run it:
     ```bash
     /Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh
     ```

4. **Check the Branch**:
   - Verify that the `Git.md` file has been pushed to the branch:
     ```bash
     git log --oneline
     git branch
     ```

#### Alternative: Manually Push `Git.md` to the Branch
If you want to push the file immediately without waiting for the script, you can do it manually:

1. **Switch to the Branch**:
   - Identify the branch name (e.g., `Git v.3x`) and switch to it:
     ```bash
     git checkout "Git v.3x"
     ```

2. **Stage and Commit the File**:
   - Stage the `Git.md` file:
     ```bash
     git add Git.md
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Updated Git.md"
     ```

3. **Push the Changes**:
   - Push the branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```

   - Start the script to monitor changes:
     ```bash
     ./auto_versioning.sh
     ```

---

### How It Works
- The script monitors your workspace for changes.
- When a file is modified, it creates a new version of the file with a timestamp.
- The new file is added and committed to Git as a separate file.

---

## Question: Why does `version_tracker.sh` need a `version_tracker.txt` file but `branch_tracker.sh` does not?

### Response:
The difference lies in how the two scripts handle version tracking and branch creation:

---

### 1. **`version_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - This script creates new versioned files (e.g., `Features v.1x.md`, `Features v.2x.md`) for each change.
- **Why It Needs `version_tracker.txt`**:
  - The script uses `version_tracker.txt` to keep track of the current version number for each file.
  - Without this file, the script would not know which version to assign to the next file.
- **How It Works**:
  - For each file, the script:
    1. Reads the current version from `version_tracker.txt`.
    2. Increments the version number.
    3. Updates `version_tracker.txt` with the new version.

---

### 2. **`branch_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - This script creates a new Git branch (e.g., `Features v.1x`, `Features v.2x`) for each change.
- **Why It Does Not Need `branch_tracker.txt`**:
  - Git itself tracks branches, so there is no need for an external file to manage branch versions.
  - The script dynamically generates branch names based on the file name and the number of existing branches.
- **How It Works**:
  - For each file, the script:
    1. Checks Git for existing branches with similar names.
    2. Creates a new branch with the next version number (e.g., `Features v.3x`).

---

### Key Difference:
- **`version_tracker.sh`**:
  - Relies on `version_tracker.txt` to manage version numbers for files because Git does not inherently track file versions as separate files.
- **`branch_tracker.sh`**:
  - Leverages Git's built-in branch management, so no external file is needed.

---

### Summary:
- `version_tracker.sh` needs `version_tracker.txt` because it tracks file versions manually.
- `branch_tracker.sh` does not need `branch_tracker.txt` because Git already tracks branches.

---

## Question: `branch_version.sh` gives me this:
`/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My\ Plugins/my\ plugin/branch_tracker.sh ; exit;`

### Response:
The message:

```
/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My\ Plugins/my\ plugin/branch_tracker.sh ; exit;
```

is not an error. It is likely the command you executed in the terminal to run the `branch_tracker.sh` script. Here's what it means:

---

### Explanation:
1. **Path to the Script**:
   - `/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My\ Plugins/my\ plugin/branch_tracker.sh`:
     - This is the full path to the `branch_tracker.sh` script you are running.
     - The `\` is used to escape the space in the folder name (`My Plugins`).

2. **`; exit;`**:
   - This is a command that tells the terminal to exit the current shell session after the script finishes running.
   - It is often appended automatically by some terminal environments (e.g., macOS Terminal) when you run a script or command.

---

### Why You See This:
- If you double-clicked the script or ran it in a terminal session, the terminal might display the command it executed, followed by `; exit;` to indicate that the session will close after the script completes.

---

### What to Do:
- If the script is running as expected (e.g., creating branches for file changes), you can ignore this message.
- If the script is not running or exiting prematurely, check for errors in the script or terminal output.

---

### How to Keep the Terminal Open:
If you want the terminal to stay open after running the script:
1. Open the terminal manually.
2. Navigate to the script's directory:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin"
   ```
3. Run the script directly:
   ```bash
   ./branch_tracker.sh
   ```

This way, the terminal will remain open, and you can see the script's output.

### Review of the `.sh` Files in Your Plugin Folder

#### 1. **`version_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - Tracks changes to files in your plugin folder and creates new versioned files for each change.
  - Each versioned file contains **only the new data added** since the last version, while reflecting any removed data.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **Version Tracking**:
     - Uses a `version_tracker.txt` file to keep track of the current version number for each file.
  2. **File Monitoring**:
     - Monitors the plugin folder for changes using `fswatch`.
  3. **Versioned File Creation**:
     - Creates a new file with a name like `Features v.2x.md` for each version.
     - The new file contains only the differences (new data added or removed) compared to the previous version.
  4. **Git Integration**:
     - Automatically commits and pushes the new versioned file to the Git repository.

- **Example Workflow**:
  - If `Features.md` is modified:
    - The script creates `Features v.1x.md`, `Features v.2x.md`, etc., with only the new changes.
    - Commits and pushes the new version to Git.

---

#### 2. **`branch_tracker.sh`**
- **Purpose**:
  - Tracks changes to files in your plugin folder and creates a new Git branch for each version.
  - Each branch contains the **cumulative data** (old and new changes combined) for the file.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **Branch Tracking**:
     - Uses a `branch_tracker.txt` file to keep track of the current version number for each file.
  2. **File Monitoring**:
     - Monitors the plugin folder for changes using `fswatch`.
  3. **Branch Creation**:
     - Creates a new branch with a name like `Features v.2x` for each version.
     - Appends new data to the file in the branch, keeping old data intact.
  4. **Latest File Download**:
     - Downloads the latest version of the file (with cumulative data) to the plugin folder.
     - The downloaded file does **not** include the version number in its filename (e.g., `Features.md`).

- **Example Workflow**:
  - If `Features.md` is modified:
    - The script creates branches like `Features v.1x`, `Features v.2x`, etc.
    - Appends new data to the file in the branch.
    - Downloads the latest version of the file (e.g., `Features.md`) to the plugin folder.

---

### Key Differences:
- **`version_tracker.sh`**:
  - Focuses on creating new versioned files for each change.
  - Each versioned file contains only the new data added since the last version.

- **`branch_tracker.sh`**:
  - Focuses on creating new branches for each version.
  - Each branch contains cumulative data (old + new changes).
  - Downloads the latest version of the file without the version number in its filename.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or modifications to these scripts!### Troubleshooting `branchtracker.sh` and `.plist` Issues
#### 1. **Validate the `.plist` File**
Run the following command to ensure the `.plist` file is valid:
```bash
plutil -lint ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
```
If there are any errors, they will be displayed.
#### 2. **Check the Script Path**
Ensure the script path in the `.plist` file is correct:
```xml
<string>/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh</string>
```
Verify that the script exists at this location:
```bash
ls -l "/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh"
```
#### 3. **Check Permissions**
Ensure the `.plist` file and the script have the correct permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
chmod +x "/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh"
```

#### 4. **Test the Script Manually**
Run the script manually to check for errors:
```bash
/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh
```
If it fails, the error message will help identify the issue.
#### 5. **Add Logging to the Script**
Modify the script to log its execution and errors. Add the following line at the top of the script:
```bash
echo "Script started at $(date)" >> /Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.log
```
This will create a log file (`branchtracker.log`) to capture the script's behavior.
#### 6. **Reload the `.plist` File**
Unload and reload the `.plist` file:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
```
#### 7. **Use `launchctl bootstrap`**
If the issue persists, try using `launchctl bootstrap`:
```bash
sudo launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.myplugin.branchtracker.plist
```
#### 8. **Check System Logs**
If the `.plist` still fails to load, check the system logs for more details:
```bash
log show --predicate 'process == "launchd"' --info
```
### How to Push `Git.md` to a Branch Using `branchtracker.sh`
#### Steps to Push `Git.md` to the Branch:
1. **Ensure the Script is Running**:
   - Verify that the `branchtracker.sh` script is running in the background:
     ```bash
     launchctl list | grep com.myplugin.branchtracker
     ```
2. **Modify the `Git.md` File**:
   - Make a small change to the `Git.md` file (e.g., add a space or a comment) to trigger the script.

3. **Manually Trigger the Script**:
   - If the script is not running, you can manually run it:
     ```bash
     /Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin/branchtracker.sh
     ```

4. **Check the Branch**:
   - Verify that the `Git.md` file has been pushed to the branch:
     ```bash
     git log --oneline
     git branch
     ```

#### Alternative: Manually Push `Git.md` to the Branch
If you want to push the file immediately without waiting for the script, you can do it manually:

1. **Switch to the Branch**:
   - Identify the branch name (e.g., `Git v.3x`) and switch to it:
     ```bash
     git checkout "Git v.3x"
     ```

2. **Stage and Commit the File**:
   - Stage the `Git.md` file:
     ```bash
     git add Git.md
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Updated Git.md"
     ```

3. **Push the Changes**:
   - Push the branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```

## Question: How do I ensure Git automatically pulls the files to itself after every change you or I make, each file as a new file, instead of updating the original file? I want the original file to be the oldest, and each change being saved as a new version in the branch.

### Response:
To ensure Git automatically saves each change as a new file (instead of updating the original file), you can implement a custom workflow. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Steps to Automate Saving Changes as New Files in Git

1. **Create a Script to Duplicate Files**:
   - Write a script that duplicates the file with a timestamp or unique identifier whenever a change is detected.

2. **Commit the New File to Git**:
   - The script will also stage and commit the new file to Git.

3. **Use a File Watcher**:
   - Use a tool like `fswatch` to monitor changes in your workspace and trigger the script.

---

### Example Script
Here’s a script that automates this process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory to watch and the Git repository
WATCH_DIR="/Users/venvaneless/Documents/My Plugins/my plugin"
BRANCH_NAME="versioned-files"

# Ensure the branch exists
git checkout -B "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Monitor changes in the directory
fswatch -o "$WATCH_DIR" | while read -r event; do
  # Get the list of changed files
  CHANGED_FILES=$(git status --porcelain | awk '{print $2}')

  for FILE in $CHANGED_FILES; do
    # Skip directories and untracked files
    if [[ -f "$FILE" ]]; then
      # Create a new version of the file with a timestamp
      TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
      EXTENSION="${FILE##*.}"
      BASENAME="${FILE%.*}"
      NEW_FILE="${BASENAME}_${TIMESTAMP}.${EXTENSION}"

      # Copy the file to create a new version
      cp "$FILE" "$NEW_FILE"

      # Add and commit the new file to Git
      git add "$NEW_FILE"
      git commit -m "New version of $FILE saved as $NEW_FILE"
    fi
  done
done
```

---

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the script as `auto_versioning.sh` in your workspace.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x auto_versioning.sh
   ```

3. **Install `fswatch`**:
   - Install `fswatch` using Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install fswatch
     ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Start the script to monitor changes:
     ```bash
     ./auto_versioning.sh
     ```

---

### How It Works
- The script monitors your workspace for changes.
- When a file is modified, it creates a new version of the file with a timestamp.
- The new file is added and committed to Git as a separate file.

---

### Workflow for Creating Versioned Files
To ensure that versioned files are saved in their respective folders (`snippets-history` for `.ts`, `versions` for `.md`, and `assets-history` for `.json`, `.js`, `.css`), we can automate this process with a script. Here’s how it works:

1. **Original File in `main` Branch**:
   - The original file (e.g., `AccordionMenu.md`) remains in the `main` branch and is not modified.

2. **Versioned Files**:
   - Each time you edit a file, a new versioned file (e.g., `AccordionMenuV1.md`, `AccordionMenuV2.md`) is created.
   - The versioned file includes:
     - The content of the original file.
     - The content of all previous versions.
     - The new changes.

3. **Automation**:
   - A script handles the creation of versioned files and commits them to the `main` branch.

---

### Example Script for Versioning
Here’s a script to automate the process:

```bash
#!/bin/zsh

# Define the folders for versioned files
ts_history_folder="snippets-history"
md_history_folder="versions"
assets_history_folder="assets-history"

# Ensure the versioned folders exist
mkdir -p "$ts_history_folder" "$md_history_folder" "$assets_history_folder"

# Iterate over the files in the workspace
for file in *.ts *.md *.json *.js *.css; do
  # Skip if no matching files are found
  if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then
    continue
  fi

  # Extract the base name and extension
  base_name=$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.[^.]*$//') # Remove extension
  extension="${file##*.}" # Extract extension

  # Determine the destination folder based on the file type
  case "$extension" in
    ts)
      history_folder="$ts_history_folder"
      ;;
    md)
      history_folder="$md_history_folder"
      ;;
    json|js|css)
      history_folder="$assets_history_folder"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Skipping unsupported file type: $file"
      continue
      ;;
  esac

  # Find the latest versioned file
  latest_version=$(ls "$history_folder/${base_name}V*.$extension" 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -n 1)

  # Determine the new version number
  if [[ -z "$latest_version" ]]; then
    new_version=1
  else
    latest_version_number=$(basename "$latest_version" | sed -E "s/.*V([0-9]+)\.$extension/\1/")
    new_version=$((latest_version_number + 1))
  fi

  # Create the new versioned file
  new_versioned_file="$history_folder/${base_name}V${new_version}.${extension}"
  echo "Creating new versioned file: $new_versioned_file"

  # Combine the content of the original file and all previous versions
  cat "$file" > "$new_versioned_file"
  for previous_version in $(ls "$history_folder/${base_name}V*.$extension" 2>/dev/null | sort -V); do
    cat "$previous_version" >> "$new_versioned_file"
  done

  # Add the new changes (if any)
  echo "# New changes for version $new_version" >> "$new_versioned_file"

  # Stage and commit the new versioned file
  git add "$new_versioned_file"
  git commit -m "Add $new_versioned_file with combined content from previous versions"
done

echo "Versioning complete!"
```

---

### How to Use the Script
1. Save the script as `version_files.sh` in your workspace.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x version_files.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./version_files.sh
   ```

---

### Expected Behavior
- **Original Files**:
  - The original files remain unchanged in their respective locations.
- **Versioned Files**:
  - `.ts` files are saved in `snippets-history`.
  - `.md` files are saved in `versions`.
  - `.json`, `.js`, and `.css` files are saved in `assets-history`.
- **Git Integration**:
  - The script automatically stages and commits the versioned files.
